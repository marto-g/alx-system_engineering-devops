Last week's terrible outage was one of the most infamous incidents in our company's history. Our servers crashed, leaving our consumers in the dark for many hours, and our staff had to deal with the worst-case scenario. 100% of our users were impacted, and they were all extremely vocal about how unhappy they were with the impact. Our social media accounts were inundated with critical comments and memes, and our support crew was inundated with irate letters. Our interns' practical joke turned out to be the main reason for the outage. They decided it would be humorous to switch to decaf for all of our waiters' coffee makers. Sadly, the IT team did not get the humor and realized.The IT crew was unaware of the joke and observed the servers' increased CPU consumption. They looked into the problem and believed, wrongly, that a recent software update was to blame. Our staff moved quickly and diligently for several hours to get the service back online. They looked into every option to bring our servers back online, even if it meant offering a few interns to the server gods. Sadly, our first theories and solutions to the issue turned out to be false. We didn't understand the root reason of the issue until we had consumed the final cup of coffee in the workplace. Eventually, the matter was raised to the upper management team, who did not find the joke amusing but appreciated it ,it was a great learning experience .
